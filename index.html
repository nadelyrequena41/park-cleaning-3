	<h3> Recent data shows that parks in the Bronx receive the most clean-up attention across NYC boroughs, despite not having the most parks. </h3> <!-- This is my subhead -->

	<p> Records from New York City’s Department of Parks and Recreation reveal a striking disparity in how often parks are cleaned across the five boroughs. Between January and June 2025, parks in the Bronx required the most clean-up and maintenance tasks, from removing medical waste and broken glass to clearing graffiti, while Staten Island saw the fewest clean up’s. Although Queens has the largest number of parks, the Bronx’s consistently higher clean-up counts point to deeper structural issues in how park resources are allocated.  </p> 

	<p> Experts, like Melissa Checker, an urban studies professor at Queens College, say these disparities reflect broader patterns of wealth inequality. </p>

	<p> “Usually, the parks in the wealthy neighborhoods have more access to resources to maintain and clean that park,” Checker said, noting that private conservancies and higher real-estate values often funnel support toward affluent areas. </p> 

	<p> As the mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, considers tax changes aimed at high-income residents, the data underscores a growing need to direct more resources to boroughs like the Bronx, where maintenance demands are greatest. </p>
